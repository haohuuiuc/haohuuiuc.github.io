Welcome to my homepage!

I am a Software Engineer at Facebook. Before joining Facebook, I worked at Esri as a Product Engineer. I obtained my Doctoral degree in Geography from the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) with the research focus on high-performance geospatial computing and machine learning. 
I held a M.S. degree from University at Buffalo and a B.S. degree from Nanjing University in China.
