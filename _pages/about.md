Welcome to my homepage!

I am a Product Engineer in the Spatial Analysis and Data Science team at Esri. I worked on large geospatial raster 
data processing that leverages distributed computing and storage technologies. 

Before joining Esri in 2018, I obtained my Doctoral degree in GIScience from the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign with the research focus on high-performance geospatial computing and machine learning. 
I held a M.S. degree from University at 
Buffalo and a B.S. degree from Nanjing University in China.
