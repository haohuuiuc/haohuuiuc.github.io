Welcome to my homepage!

I am a Product Engineer in the Spatial Analysis and Data Science team at Esri, specialized in spatial
 analysis and modeling tools for raster (cell-based) data. Particularly, I am interested in geospatial 
 machine learning and large raster data processing that leverages distributed computing and storage technologies. 

Before joining Esri in 2018, I obtained my Doctoral degree in Geography from the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) with the research focus on high-performance geospatial computing and machine learning. 
I held a M.S. degree from University at Buffalo and a B.S. degree from Nanjing University in China.
