Welcome to my homepage!

I am a Product Engineer in the Spatial Analysis and Data Science team at Esri. I worked on large geospatial raster 
data processing that leverages distributed computing and storage technologies. 

Before joining Esri in 2018, I completed my Doctoral degree in Geography from the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign researching on high-performance geospatial computing and machine learning.
